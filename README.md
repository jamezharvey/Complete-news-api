# Welcome to my frontend project!

As part of the Northcoders bootcamp, I was tasked with creating a news website, using a pre-provided backend api. The intention is to mimic the functionality of forum sites like Reddit, while gaining practical knowledge for building a front end using React.

## Setup

**Prerequisite**: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16 or above)

First, clone the repo and head into the root directory:

`git clone https://github.com/jamezharvey/NC-Front-End.git`

`cd NC-Front-End`

Now install the project's dependencies:

`npm install`

The app can now be run locally:

`npm start`
